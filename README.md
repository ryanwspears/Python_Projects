# Python Projects
These are some small projects I made using Python.

## Projects
- [Phonebook](https://github.com/ryanwspears/Python_Projects/commit/48a308b0179f8b30457729c3098dc347917db6f7)
- [Check Files](https://github.com/ryanwspears/Python_Projects/blob/main/fileTransfer.py)

### Phonebook
This project serves as a phonebook for the user. It allows the user to input a person's name, phone number, and email address in a databse that can be updated and deleted as needed.

### Check Files
Allows the user to copy all .txt files that have been created or modified within the past 24 hours from one directory to another.
